How would the track be defined?
-------------------------------
- We need a track definition / format
  - To be used by the game engine
  - To be passed to the players



The track itself
----------------



Additional items on the track
-----------------------------




Should players see the whole track in advance of playing?
---------------------------------------------------------
- An alternative is that the players just see what a human player
  would see if they were playing a 3D game

- They would see a ray-casted subset of the track in front of them

- I think that this would be rather complicated

- Also players may want to look behind them, or to the side

- Another alternative is that players see a rectangular subset of the track around where they are

- This still seems not quite right, as they might want to be able to see further ahead
  or across corners (as if they had line of sight in 3D)

- I propose that player can see the whole track at all times

- This means that players can see:
  - The whole track layout in advance of playing
  - The location of all players on the track at all times
  - The locations of special items and hazards at all times
  - The location of the start line


Direction markers / info
------------------------
- I think that there should be some kind of direction indication at each point
  around the track

- So that players know easily which direction they are supposed to be going

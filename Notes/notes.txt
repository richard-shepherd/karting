Overview
--------
- A game roughly in the style of Mario Kart with players controlled by external AIs.


AIs
---
- AIs will be external executables which communicate via stdin and stdout.

- The main game program will spawn the AI exes and establish communication with them.

- The main game program will initiate all communication
  - Providing an update on the game state
  - Requesting new actions


2D with a 3D view?
------------------
- The track could be essentially 2D

- There could be an option to render it in 3D to make it look more exciting
  - But the game would be essentially 2D

- There could be jumps, maybe?
  - Even so, this would just be a temporary addition of height to player positions 
  - The track itself would still be 2D
